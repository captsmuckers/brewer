Brewer - A Sharkord Multi-Server Client
Brewer is a Windows desktop client for Sharkord built on the Electron framework. Currently provides the ability to connect to multiple servers.

Note: In this version, if you join a voice channel and switch to a different server and join that voice channel, you will not be disconnected from the original voice channel. Also, streaming apps and desktops works, but there is currently no audio.


DISCLAIMER: This desktop app was created using Gemini.
